# Metal
A toy deep learning framework. This repo consist of my multiple deep learning tutorial and github repos group together to form this project.

## Requirements
Python 3.6+<br>
Autograd [clone from here](https://github.com/miguelmyers8/autodiff)
## Installation
Install this repo locally from top directory. <br/>
$ pip install -e .

### Todo
- [ ] Finish Unittest
- [ ] Clean cpp Package
- [ ] Integrate cupy for gpu computation into autograd
- [ ] Solver need optimization. way too slow
- [ ] conv2D need optimization. way too slow (unitls.con2d is twice as slow when imported and used in con2d class)
- [ ] Integrate viz. saliency-maps
- [ ] data augmentation
